# Domain Modeling
1. An entitity that stores data in properties and contain behaviors in methods is referred to usually as an object oriented model.
2. This helps to change an algorithm for and having changes be small and targeted when the time comes.
## Summary
1. When modeling a single entity that'll have many instances, build self-contained objects with the same attributes and behaviors.
1. Model its behaviors with small methods that focus on doing on job well.
1. Create instances using the 'new' keyword followed by a call to a constructor function.
1. Model its attributes with a constructor function that defines and initializes properties.
1. store the newly created object in a variable so you can access its properties and methods from outside.
1. Use the 'this' variable within methods so you can access the object's properties and methods from inside.

# Tables
1. table in triangle brackets = to create a table
1. tr in triangle brackets = indicates the start of each row and followed by ->
1. td in triangle brackets = this is each cell of the table.
1. th in triangle brackets = is table headings, this shows the heading above each row.
1. colspan and rowspan allow you to take up multiple spots in the table with the same value.

# Functions Methods and Objects
1. THIS (it is a keyword0)
1. global scope = parent scope
1. arrays = 'something' [listof things]
1. .length toUpperCase() toLowerCase() charAT() indexOf() lastIndexOf() substring() split() trim() replace()
1.  Math.round() Math.swrt(n) Math.ceil() Math.floor() Math.random()
