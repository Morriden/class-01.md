# INTRODUCTION TO CSS

    This section really made some things click. Anyone i've asked to help me knows I dislike CSS (all of the TA's, dani, and everyone else). Reading this chapter really helped me out. Some things that I find really exciting.

    You can specify multiple selectors in the same line!

    ```CSS
    h1, h2, h3 {
        color: green;
    }
    ```

    This was exciting, I've always spaced these out and typed way to much!
