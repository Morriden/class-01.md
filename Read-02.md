# INTRODUCTION TO CSS

    This section really made some things click. Anyone i've asked to help me knows I dislike CSS (all of the TA's, dani, and everyone else). Reading this chapter really helped me out. Some things that I find really exciting.

    You can specify multiple selectors in the same line!

    ```CSS

    }
