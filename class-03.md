# CHAPTER 13 BOXES (WHATS IN THE BOX)

I highly enjoyed this section, I find CSS difficult and I found myself marking a lot of the pages in my book for quick refernce.
One of my favorite lines of code I found was

```CSS
p.one {
    border-top-color: green;
    border-bottom-color: white;
    border-left-color: black;
    border-right-color: purple;
}
```
This causes the border of p.one to be four different colors!!!!!

# CHAPTER 4 DECISIONS AND LOOPS

I have actually been reading this chapter through the day trying to solve the issues I was having myself.
My favorite thing I took from this chapter is the switch statements.

```JS
switch (level) {
    case1:
        msg = 'good luck on the first test';
        break;
}
```
This seemed like a interesting way to do more if/else statements. I'm wondering if we are going
to go over this in class or if this is a bad practice.
